# NodeNPS
A Net Promoter Score API written in node.js

Created during NLW #04, a web event in Brazil by RocketSeat with the objective of getting a series of programmers to develop the same application over the course 
of a week, hence the name Next Level Week :)

The goal of the project is to allow storing the e-mail and name of multiple users and surveys from companies that they'd like to send to those users,
e,g: "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend our JavaScript course to a friend?".
The HTML for the e-mail itself can be customized under views/emails.
